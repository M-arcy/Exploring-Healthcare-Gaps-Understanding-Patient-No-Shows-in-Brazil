# üìä Brazilian Healthcare No-Show Analysis

Welcome to the repository for the **Brazilian Healthcare No-Show Analysis** project! This project explores patterns and predictors of patient attendance in Brazil's healthcare system using the *No-show Appointments* dataset from Kaggle, which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joniarroba/noshowappointments).

## üöÄ Project Overview

Missed healthcare appointments pose challenges to medical systems worldwide. Using a rich dataset of over 110,000 medical appointments in Brazil, this project investigates:

- Factors influencing patient attendance.
- The role of chronic conditions, SMS reminders, and socioeconomic factors.
- Key insights into actionable healthcare strategies.

## üîç Research Questions

1. **What demographic and socioeconomic factors influence no-show rates?**
2. **How do chronic conditions, such as hypertension and diabetes, affect attendance?**
3. **What is the impact of SMS reminders on reducing no-shows?**

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**
  - Standardized column names, handled missing/duplicate data, and resolved outliers.
  - Converted categorical variables to appropriate formats to optimize memory.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Visualized age distribution, gender attendance patterns, and neighborhood trends.
  - Investigated relationships between chronic conditions, scholarships, and attendance.

- **Statistical Testing:**
  - Conducted chi-square tests to assess associations (e.g., handicap levels and no-show rates).
  - Explored significant findings to support policy recommendations.

## üìà Key Findings

- **Handicap Levels & No-Show Rates:**
  Patients with higher handicap levels (3 and 4) show significantly higher no-show rates, indicating a need for targeted interventions.

- **SMS Notifications:**
  Contrary to expectations, SMS reminders correlate with higher no-show rates, warranting further investigation.

- **Scholarship Enrollment:**
  Patients enrolled in the scholarship program have slightly higher no-show rates, potentially linked to socioeconomic barriers.
